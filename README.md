Hello there!
Install the tampermonkey extension on your browser first.
Go to the Tampermonkey control panel.
Then press the plus button next to the installed user scripts.
Delete the sample code on the screen.
Paste the script codes I publish.
You'll now be able to see a download link at the far right of the comment field while watching youtube videos.
